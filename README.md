C++ Sorting: 

What does Sort function in C++ do? You will understand it in the C++ code below:
 
                                          #include <iostream>
                                          #include <bits/stdc++.h>
                                          
                                          using namespace std;
                                          
                                          int main()
                                          {
                                             //code
                                          }
